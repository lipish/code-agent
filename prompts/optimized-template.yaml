# Planning guidelines
planning:
  when_to_plan:
    - "Task requires multiple actions over time"
    - "Logical phases or dependencies exist"
    - "Work has ambiguity needing high-level goals"
    - "User asked for multiple things"
    - "Need intermediate checkpoints for feedback"
  
  plan_quality:
    good:
      - "Break into meaningful, logical steps"
      - "Each step is verifiable"
      - "Steps are ordered by dependencies"
      - "5-7 words per step maximum"
      - "Focus on tangible actions"
    bad:
      - "Stating the obvious"
      - "Padding with filler steps"
      - "Steps you can't actually do"
      - "Too vague or too detailed"
  
  examples:
    high_quality:
      - "Add CLI entry with file args"
      - "Parse Markdown via CommonMark library"
      - "Apply semantic HTML template"
      - "Handle code blocks, images, links"
      - "Add error handling for invalid files"
    low_quality:
      - "Create CLI tool"
      - "Add Markdown parser"
      - "Convert to HTML"

# Validation guidelines
validation:
  philosophy: "Start specific, then broader"
  
  when_to_test:
    - "After implementing new functionality"
    - "After fixing bugs"
    - "When test patterns exist in codebase"
    - "In non-interactive modes (always)"
  
  when_not_to_test:
    - "In interactive modes (suggest first)"
    - "When no tests exist in codebase"
    - "For unrelated code"
  
  commands:
    - "cargo build --all-features"
    - "cargo test --all-features"
    - "cargo clippy -- -D warnings"
    - "cargo fmt --check"
