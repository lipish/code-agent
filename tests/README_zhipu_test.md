# Agent Workflow Test - Zhipu GLM-4.6

This test demonstrates the complete Task Runner agent workflow using Zhipu GLM-4.6, as described in the main README_CN.md.

## Test Overview

The test validates the three-phase agent workflow:

1. **任务理解 (Task Understanding)** - AI analyzes the task requirements
2. **任务执行 (Task Execution)** - Agent executes the planned approach  
3. **结果生成 (Result Generation)** - Results are formatted and returned

## Configuration

- **Provider**: Zhipu (智谱AI)
- **Model**: glm-4-flash (for faster testing)
- **API Endpoint**: https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4
- **Max Tokens**: 1000
- **Temperature**: 0.7

## Test Cases

### 1. Basic Connectivity Test (`test_zhipu_basic_connectivity`)
- Tests basic API connectivity
- Validates authentication and response
- Uses simple English prompt for quick verification

### 2. Agent Workflow Test (`test_zhipu_agent_workflow`)  
- Tests complete agent workflow end-to-end
- Uses Chinese task: "简单解释什么是Rust编程语言的特点"
- Validates all three workflow phases
- Shows task plan details including understanding, approach, and complexity

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all Zhipu tests with output
cargo test test_zhipu -- --nocapture

# Run individual tests
cargo test test_zhipu_basic_connectivity -- --nocapture
cargo test test_zhipu_agent_workflow -- --nocapture
```

## Expected Output

Both tests should pass successfully, showing:
- ✅ Model and agent creation
- ✅ API connectivity and authentication
- ✅ Task processing with Chinese language support
- ✅ Complete workflow execution with timing metrics

## Test Results Interpretation

### Success Indicators
- `test_zhipu_basic_connectivity ... ok` - API works correctly
- `test_zhipu_agent_workflow ... ok` - Full workflow operational
- Response includes "Hello from GLM!" for basic test
- Agent workflow shows plan understanding and execution results

### Architecture Validation

This test validates the modular architecture described in README:
- ✅ Configuration system working correctly
- ✅ LLM connector integration functional  
- ✅ Agent workflow phases operational
- ✅ Chinese language task processing
- ✅ Planning engine generating task plans
- ✅ Result generation with metrics

The successful execution of these tests confirms that the Arc-optimized architecture and modular design are working as intended with the Zhipu GLM-4.6 provider.
