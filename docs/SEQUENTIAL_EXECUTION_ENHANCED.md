# Sequential Execution - Enhanced Implementation

**Phase 4: Enhanced Step Parsing and Real Execution**

This document describes the enhanced implementation of the sequential execution system with detailed step parsing and real operation execution capabilities.

## Overview

Phase 4 completes the sequential execution system by:

1. **Enhanced Step Parsing** - Parses detailed step information from LLM responses
2. **Real File Operations** - Executes actual file create/read/modify operations
3. **Real Command Execution** - Runs shell commands with safety validation
4. **Code Generation** - Uses LLM to generate code and write to files
5. **Testing Integration** - Runs test suites and captures results
6. **Step Type Handlers** - Specialized handling for each step type

## Enhanced Planning Parser

### Supported Step Format

The planning parser now supports detailed STEP format from LLM responses:

```
STEPS:
- STEP_1:
  NAME: Initialize Project
  DESCRIPTION: Create project structure
  TYPE: Preparation
  DURATION: 5
  PRECONDITIONS: Workspace available
  OUTPUTS: project directory
  VALIDATION: Directory exists

- STEP_2:
  NAME: Generate Code
  DESCRIPTION: Create main.rs file
  TYPE: CodeGeneration
  DURATION: 10
```

### Parsed Fields

Each step is parsed with:

- **NAME**: Step name (used in execution logs)
- **DESCRIPTION**: What the step does (guides execution)
- **TYPE**: One of 8 supported types (determines execution method)
- **DURATION**: Estimated minutes (for progress tracking)
- **PRECONDITIONS**: What must be ready before execution
- **OUTPUTS**: Expected outputs (files, artifacts, etc.)
- **VALIDATION**: How to verify success

### Step Types

The parser recognizes these step types:

| Type | Keyword | Execution Behavior |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `Preparation` | preparation | Environment setup, initialization |
| `CodeGeneration` | code/codegeneration | LLM-based code generation |
| `Configuration` | config/configuration | Config file creation/modification |
| `FileOperation` | file/fileoperation | File create/read/modify/delete |
| `CommandExecution` | command/commandexecution | Shell command execution |
| `Testing` | test/testing | Test suite execution |
| `Deployment` | deploy/deployment | Application deployment |
| `Cleanup` | cleanup | Resource cleanup |

### Dependency Parsing

Dependencies are parsed from the LLM response:

```
DEPENDENCIES:
- STEP_1 -> STEP_2
- STEP_2 -> STEP_3
```

This creates `StepDependency` objects with:
- `step_id`: The dependent step ID
- `depends_on`: The prerequisite step ID
- `dependency_type`: `StrictDependency` (must succeed)
- `condition`: Optional conditional dependency

## Real Execution Implementation

### File Operations

#### Create Files

When step description contains "create" or "ÂàõÂª∫":

```rust
// Creates file with header comment
let content = format!("// Generated by agent-runner\n// Step: {}\n", step.name);
write_file(output, &content).await?;
```

**Results**:
- Files added to `generated_files` and `modified_files`
- Logs include "‚úÖ Created file: path/to/file"

#### Read Files

When step description contains "read" or "ËØªÂèñ":

```rust
match read_file(output).await {
    Ok(content) => {
        logs.push(format!("‚úÖ Read {} bytes from {}", content.len(), output));
    }
}
```

#### Modify Files

When step description contains "modify" or "‰øÆÊîπ":

```rust
// Reads existing content
let content = read_file(output).await?;
// Appends modification marker
let new_content = format!("{}\n// Modified by agent-runner\n", content);
write_file(output, &new_content).await?;
```

### Command Execution

Commands are executed directly from step description:

```rust
let cmd_str = step.description.trim();
match run_command(cmd_str).await {
    Ok(output) => {
        executed_commands.push(cmd_str.to_string());
        logs.push(format!("‚úÖ Command output: {}", output));
    }
}
```

**Safety**: All commands go through `GuardrailEngine` before execution:
- Whitelist validation (only allowed commands)
- Dangerous pattern detection (rm -rf, sudo, etc.)
- Risk level assessment
- User confirmation for high-risk operations

### Code Generation

Uses the LLM to generate code:

```rust
let prompt = format!(
    "Generate code for the following requirement:\n{}\n\nProvide only the code without explanations.",
    step.description
);

match self.model.complete(&prompt).await {
    Ok(response) => {
        // Extract code from markdown blocks
        let code = extract_code_block(&response.content);
        
        // Write to expected output files
        for output_file in &step.expected_outputs {
            write_file(output_file, &code).await?;
        }
    }
}
```

**Features**:
- Extracts code from markdown blocks (```)
- Writes to all expected output files
- Logs generation statistics (lines of code)
- Handles generation failures gracefully

### Testing

Runs test suites and captures results:

```rust
match run_command("cargo test --quiet").await {
    Ok(test_output) => {
        executed_commands.push("cargo test".to_string());
        logs.push(format!("‚úÖ Tests passed: {}", test_output));
    }
    Err(e) => {
        logs.push(format!("‚ö†Ô∏è  Testing skipped or failed: {}", e));
    }
}
```

### Configuration

Handles configuration file creation:

```rust
for output in &step.expected_outputs {
    if output.ends_with(".toml") || output.ends_with(".json") || output.ends_with(".yaml") {
        let config_content = format!("# Configuration generated by agent-runner\n# {}", step.description);
        write_file(output, &config_content).await?;
    }
}
```

### Other Step Types

- **Preparation**: Environment setup (50ms simulation)
- **Deployment**: Application deployment (100ms simulation)
- **Cleanup**: Resource cleanup (50ms simulation)

## Step Execution Output

Each step produces a `StepExecutionOutput`:

```rust
pub struct StepExecutionOutput {
    pub step_id: String,
    pub status: ExecutionStatus,
    pub outputs: HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>,
    pub logs: Vec<String>,
    pub generated_files: Vec<String>,
    pub modified_files: Vec<String>,
    pub executed_commands: Vec<String>,
}
```

### Log Examples

LLM response received: 342 chars
‚úÖ Generated code written to: src/handler.rs
Code generation completed: 15 lines
Execution completed successfully
```

## Integration with Guardrails

Before executing any step, the system:

1. **Determines Operation Type** from `StepType`:
   - `FileOperation` ‚Üí Check description for create/delete/modify
   - `CommandExecution` ‚Üí `CommandWrite` or `CommandDelete`
   - `Configuration` ‚Üí `ConfigModify`
   - `Deployment` ‚Üí `DeployStart`

2. **Creates Operation Targets** from `expected_outputs`

3. **Calls GuardrailEngine**:
   ```rust
   let guard = guardrail_engine.check_operation(
       operation_type,
       &step.description,
       targets,
   )?;
   ```

4. **Logs Risk Information**:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Guardrail check: üü† Medium risk operation detected
      Operation: FileDelete
      Impact: 3 files, 0 directories
      Dangerous patterns detected:
        - file_delete: Deleting files can cause data loss
   ```

5. **Requests Confirmation** if needed (auto-approved in demo mode)

## Example: Complete Step Execution

Given this task: "Create a Rust module for user authentication"

### 1. Understanding Phase

```yaml
UNDERSTANDING: Create authentication module with login/logout functions
KEY_REQUIREMENTS:
  - Password hashing
  - Session management
  - Security best practices
TASK_TYPE: code_development
COMPLEXITY: Moderate
```

### 2. Approach Phase

```yaml
APPROACH: Implement secure auth module using bcrypt and JWT
TECH_STACK:
  - Rust
  - bcrypt crate
  - jsonwebtoken crate
ARCHITECTURE: Modular design with separation of concerns
```

### 3. Planning Phase

```yaml
STEPS:
- STEP_1:
  NAME: Create module structure
  DESCRIPTION: Create auth module files
  TYPE: FileOperation
  DURATION: 2
  OUTPUTS:
    - src/auth/mod.rs

```
Started execution of: Create module structure
Description: Create auth module files
Type: FileOperation
‚úÖ Created file: src/auth/mod.rs
‚úÖ Created file: src/auth/password.rs
‚úÖ Created file: src/auth/session.rs
Execution completed successfully
```

**Step 2** (CodeGeneration):
```
Started execution of: Implement password hashing
Description: Generate password hashing functions using bcrypt
Type: CodeGeneration
Generating code with LLM...
LLM response received: 856 chars
‚úÖ Generated code written to: src/auth/password.rs
Code generation completed: 35 lines
Execution completed successfully
```

**Step 3** (Testing):
```
Started execution of: Run tests
Description: cargo test --package auth
Type: Testing
Running tests...
Executing command: cargo test --quiet
‚úÖ Tests passed: running 4 tests

test auth::password::test_verify ... ok
Execution completed successfully
```

### 5. Validation Phase

```yaml

GENERATED_FILES: 3
MODIFIED_FILES: 4
EXECUTED_COMMANDS: 1
VALIDATION_MESSAGES:
  - All 3 steps executed successfully

```

## Performance Characteristics

### Step Execution Times

| Step Type | Typical Duration | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Preparation | 50-100ms | Environment checks |
| FileOperation | 10-50ms | Per file operation |
| CodeGeneration | 2-10s | LLM response time |
| CommandExecution | Variable | Depends on command |
| Testing | 1-30s | Full test suite |
| Configuration | 10-50ms | Config file creation |
| Deployment | 100-500ms | Simulated deployment |
| Cleanup | 50-100ms | Resource cleanup |

### Guardrail Overhead

- Risk assessment: 1-5ms
- Pattern detection: <1ms
- User confirmation prompt: Variable (user dependent)

## Error Handling

Each operation handles errors gracefully:

### File Operation Errors

```rust
Err(e) => {
    logs.push(format!("‚ùå Failed to create file {}: {}", output, e));
    // Continue with next file unless step.allow_failure=false
}
```

### Command Execution Errors

```rust
Err(e) => {
    logs.push(format!("‚ùå Command execution failed: {}", e));
    // Don't fail step for some command types
}
```

### Code Generation Errors

```rust
Err(e) => {
    logs.push(format!("‚ùå Code generation failed: {}", e));
    // Step validation will determine if retry is needed
}
```

## Configuration

Control execution behavior through `ExecutionConfig`:

```rust
let config = ExecutionConfig {
    max_retries_per_phase: 2,      // Retry failed LLM calls
    require_confirmation: true,     // Require user confirmation for risky ops
    min_confidence_threshold: 0.7,  // Minimum confidence to proceed
    enable_auto_rollback: true,     // Rollback on failure
    verbose_logging: true,          // Detailed execution logs
};
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Parallel Step Execution** - Execute independent steps concurrently
2. **Real Snapshot System** - Create actual file snapshots before risky operations
3. **Conditional Dependencies** - Execute steps based on runtime conditions
4. **Step Templates** - Pre-defined step templates for common operations
5. **Progress Callbacks** - Real-time progress updates for UI integration
6. **Execution Metrics** - Detailed metrics on execution performance
7. **Step Retry Logic** - Configurable retry for failed steps
8. **Dry Run Mode** - Preview execution without making changes

### Under Consideration

- **Distributed Execution** - Execute steps across multiple machines
- **Checkpoint/Resume** - Save execution state and resume later
- **Step Caching** - Cache step results to avoid re-execution
- **Custom Validators** - User-defined validation functions
- **Execution Hooks** - Pre/post execution hooks for custom logic

## Best Practices

### Step Design

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each step should do one thing well
2. **Clear Descriptions** - Step description guides execution, be specific
3. **Realistic Durations** - Provide accurate time estimates
4. **Expected Outputs** - List all files/artifacts the step will produce
5. **Validation Criteria** - Define how to verify step success

### Error Handling

1. **Use allow_failure** - For non-critical steps
2. **Enable Snapshots** - For destructive operations
3. **Set Preconditions** - Verify environment before execution
4. **Provide Rollback** - Define how to undo step changes

### Performance

1. **Minimize LLM Calls** - Cache responses when possible
2. **Batch File Operations** - Group file ops in single step
3. **Optimize Commands** - Use efficient commands with minimal output
4. **Parallel Planning** - Design steps for parallel execution

## Conclusion
